          <span style="font-size: 3rem; font-weight: 700;">User</span>-generated content (UGC) has
revolutionized how communities access and share information, offering
unprecedented opportunities for real-time engagement and empowerment. Platforms
like Citizen exemplify this transformation, enabling ordinary individuals to
become active participants in public safety. By blending crowdsourced content
with official data, Citizen reshapes narratives, fosters transparency, and
bridges information gaps in underserved areas. However, this innovation also
comes with significant challenges. From misinformation to over-surveillance,
the risks of UGC highlight the complexities of balancing technological
advancement with ethical and social responsibility.&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>UGC
Unveiled: Citizen’s Gateway to Real-Time Safety and Community Engagement</b>&nbsp;<br>
          <br>User-generated content (UGC) is a vital feature of Citizen.
By combining UGC with information from official sources, Citizen has built a
platform that facilitates real-time sharing of local emergency events,
empowering community members to actively participate in the dissemination of
safety information. Citizen’s UGC features encompass a wide range of
functionalities. Users can post their own incident reports, upload photos and
videos, and comment on ongoing events. If a user is near the event, they are encouraged
to “Go Live” and stream video to the platform which can be viewed by others in
real time. This highly interactive model transforms users from passive
recipients of information into active creators and sharers of critical content.
        </p>
        <img class="u-expanded-width u-image u-image-contain u-image-default u-image-2" src="images/image11.png" alt="" data-image-width="940" data-image-height="498">
        <p class="u-align-justify u-custom-font u-font-merriweather u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> Citizen’s UGC feature stands out in
its ability to deliver timely and transparent information during critical
events. For example, during the 2017 pipe bomb attack near Times Square,
Citizen demonstrated its capacity to disseminate vital updates at remarkable
speed. Within just three minutes of the explosion, notifications had reached
627 users within a 5-mile radius. By the 12-minute mark, live streams from the
scene were being viewed by over 7,000 users within a 1-mile radius. The
reactions on social media were overwhelmingly positive and thankful. With no
question, these alerts reached the individuals that were most likely to be in
danger far faster than traditional news reporting could have.&nbsp;<br>To ensure the credibility and
reliability of the information shared, Citizen claims that every reported
incident is reviewed by their team in real time and it is confirmed by scanning
police radio before being made public. This process is crucial in preventing
the spread of misinformation, especially during sensitive events such as false
alerts about terrorist attacks, which could cause undue panic. However, despite
its undeniable potential, UGC also brings with it a host of challenges and
controversies. Issues such as the accuracy of UGC, user behavior, and the
broader societal implications of crowdsourced reporting highlight the
complexities of this approach.&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Using
Crowdsourcing for a Safer Society: When the Crowd Rules</b>&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The essence of UGC is a form of
crowd-sourced information. It represents a type of online participative
activity where volunteers contribute their diverse knowledge and experiences in
response to an open call by an organization. As a crime strategist noted when
discussing Citizen, “Rather than having a small, elite force of highly trained
government agents here to protect us all, we’re much better off having average
and ordinary citizens approaching this problem as a group and seeing what we
can do.” In these scenarios, the crowd, which is sometimes seen as a threat,
becomes an invaluable resource that can complement traditional law enforcement
through collective intelligence.&nbsp;<br>To favor participation in such
initiatives, the reward offered is usually a key element. It is necessary to
establish effective incentive mechanisms to attract a large enough crowd to
provide the desired contribution. This motivation can be intrinsic or
extrinsic. Behavioral studies on crowdsourcing highlight the significant role
of intrinsic motivation in encouraging volunteer participation. Individuals are
often driven by a sense of altruism and a desire to contribute to the safety
and well-being of their communities. For instance, they may participate to
enhance neighborhood safety while also benefiting from improved personal
safety. Additionally, they gain valuable insights into local traffic conditions,
ongoing incidents, or crime levels in their area. The primary motivations
behind such participation are typically rooted in a sense of justice, the
aspiration to help others by preventing further victimization, and the
fulfillment of being part of a meaningful cause.&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Reshaping
Narratives: How UGC Empowers Communities and Enhances Safety</b>&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Beyond its remarkable timeliness
mentioned above, UGC reshapes the power of narrative. With UGC, residents can
directly share their perspectives without relying on official narratives. This
decentralized mode of information dissemination empowers ordinary individuals
to become “community journalists,” enhancing transparency and democratizing
access to information.&nbsp;<br>UGC also enables a sense of
empowerment, allowing ordinary individuals to take an active role in shaping
the safety of their communities. Unlike traditional systems that rely solely on
institutional control, this participatory approach decentralizes power,
granting citizens a voice and role in responding to crises. This sense of
empowerment often strengthens community bonds and collective responsibility, as
contributors realize the tangible impact of their participation. Moreover,
during emergencies or crises, platforms like Citizen enable emotional support by
facilitating connections among neighbors, reinforcing the social fabric of
communities.
The broad participation enabled by
UGC also improves information coverage, especially for communities in “news
deserts” or those experiencing “data voids.” For marginalized groups, Citizen
provides an invaluable resource for accessing critical updates about local
incidents. As one user noted, “For many underserved communities, knowing about
crime is a necessity.” By involving these groups in information creation and dissemination,
UGC fills gaps left by traditional media and ensures that no community is left
uninformed.&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Challenges
of UGC in Citizen: Risks and Controversies</b>
          <br>
          <br><b>Information
Disorder: The Challenge of Quality Control</b>&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Although there are many potential
benefits of UGC, the quality control of crowd contributions stands out as one
of the most significant challenges. Crowds can create the information contents
but at the same time can facilitate information disorder: misinformation,
disinformation and mal-information. Crowd created information is a dominant
element in what is sometimes called the post-truth era. A small piece of
misleading information can constitute significant challenges to the information
sharing group or society. This misinformation can reshape in various ways how
information-driven communities make sense of their world. Unchecked
misinformation on Citizen can erode trust, fuel unnecessary panic, or distort
public perceptions of safety.

Power of the Narrative: Liberation or Control?</b>
          <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;<br>
            <br>Nicol Turner Lee
          </span>, director of the
Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution says:
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="u-clearfix u-section-3" id="sec-bffd">
      <div class="u-clearfix u-sheet u-sheet-1">
        <div class="u-align-left u-border-3 u-border-color-2-base u-expanded-width u-left-0 u-shape u-shape-1"></div>
        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-oswald u-text u-text-1">"Whoever is in control of that information, or whoever controls that app or that platform, they control the narrative" </p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-custom-font u-font-merriweather u-text u-text-2"> On Citizen, the coexistence of the
empowerment of narrative rights and the centralization of information control
rights not only brings the liberating power of decentralization, but also the
hidden danger of centralization leading to bias and conflict.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Hamid Khan, founder of the Stop LAPD
Spying Coalition, an anti-police-surveillance group, sees Citizen as part of a
“culture of deputization and vigilantism” built on the “see something, say
something” ethos of neighborhood watch, now “taking a more technological sort
of spin.” He says tools like Citizen, driven by the biases that are often
unavoidable in UGC, “are becoming a license to racially profile and go after
some of the most vulnerable community members - particularly the unhoused - and
to criminalize them.” Khan sees a direct line from 19th-century militias and
slave-catching agencies to modern-day policing, all of which serve to create a
“stalker state” in which “white supremacy is maintained,” race and poverty are
policed, “land is secured and preserved,” and “undesirables” are removed from
society. At the same time, UGC may reinforce the image of certain areas as
“dangerous” or “criminal,” leading to geographic discrimination. This
phenomenon exacerbates the divide between communities, stigmatizes entire
communities, and places a large group of people under additional scrutiny.&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Turning
Neighbors into Informants: The Risk of Over-Surveillance</b>&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The UGC function encourages people
to go towards crime scenes so that they can film them, rather than stay away
from them. Safety experts and police departments alike have given warnings
about the danger of this. Jim Thatcher, an urban studies professor at the
University of Washington, Tacoma, points out: “If you give people this power to
draw attention based around a dangerous event, then they are actually
encouraged to seek out, or at worst manufacture, these dangerous events.”
Additionally, UGC risks normalizing hyper-surveillance in residential areas. As
Bridget Bridges, a doctoral student at the University of Pennsylvania, notes,
“Citizen turns neighbors into informants, encouraging them to fear and report
‘suspicious’ neighbors.” This culture of suspicion can erode trust within
communities and transform monitoring into a harmful hobby. For some users, the act
of reporting itself becomes a form of entertainment, exacerbating tensions and
increasing the likelihood of misreporting.
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-center u-custom-font u-font-merriweather u-text u-text-3"><b>Recommendations</b>
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-custom-font u-font-merriweather u-text u-text-4"><b>Strengthen
Content Moderation with Cross-Verification</b>&nbsp;<br>Citizen should implement a robust
moderation framework that combines AI tools, human oversight, and
cross-verification mechanisms. AI can swiftly filter out potentially harmful or
inaccurate content, while human moderators provide context-sensitive judgment.
Additionally, cross-verification processes—such as comparing multiple user
reports, corroborating information with reliable third-party sources, or using
location-specific data—can ensure greater accuracy. This layered approach
minimizes misinformation while maintaining the platform’s timeliness.&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Educate
Users on Responsible Reporting</b>&nbsp;<br>Citizen should actively educate its
user base about responsible and ethical reporting practices. This can include
providing short tutorials, clear guidelines, and interactive training modules
on identifying biases, ensuring accuracy, and prioritizing safety over
sensationalism. Citizen could also implement a reward system to incentivize
users for submitting verified and non-biased reports, fostering a culture of
responsible participation.&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Limit Risks in Live Reporting</b>&nbsp;<br>To address the dangers of live streaming near active crime
scenes, Citizen should encourage users to prioritize their safety by reporting
incidents from a secure distance. The platform could implement geofencing tools
to restrict live streaming in hazardous zones and provide safety prompts or
notifications to remind users of potential risks. Educating users about safe
practices and the importance of avoiding danger while reporting incidents would
further promote responsible and secure engagement.
